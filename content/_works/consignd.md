## Why did it matter?

Humans are the product of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. Our species existence is a testament to an ability to recognize danger. Sight is among the key factors in determining how safe we feel. Visual properties like contrast, scale, movement and position allow us to make sense of our surroundings. Understanding timing —how long it takes for visual properties to change— helps us identify unnatural elements in our environment. Imagine walking through the forest and a branch rustles in your periphery. We’ve evolved to register changes (e.g., movement) whose timing doesn’t match our expectations as potentially dangerous. Whether the branch’s motion is the result of a predator or a gust of wind, the momentary unease we end up feeling is the same.

## What did I do?

Where does our sense of timing come from? The laws of physics: gravitational acceleration, conservation of momentum and the theory of relativity. Because the physical world is our first ‘user interface’ we’ve developed expectations of how things should act through trial and error. When interfacing with computers, ideas of what’s ‘natural’ are no longer automatic. Immense processing power nullifies the laws of physics for screens and gives digital designers unprecedented control over the cadence of each change or animation and with it the user’s confidence in a digital environment.
