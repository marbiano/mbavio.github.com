## Why did it matter?

Because there needs to be a better way to discover things in the world. A smarter system, without all the noise around. You want to go somewhere, you find the best tips and people to connect with in Worldly with a simple search. It would make people’s lifes easier. And that’s a mission I was ready to stand by.

## What did I do?

From start, I was in charge of the user interface of the platform. There was a lot of ideas already beeing implemented and skilled engineers working on them, but the UI was still in progress and in serious need of becoming a system.

I worked on typography, colors and layout first, always trying to stay truthful to my own design voice: UI should be as invisible as possible, in order to highlight the real features of the system without creating distraction with extra decoration.

I then took a shot at doing the identity for the platform, accepting my own limitations (I’m not an identity designer), I went for something simple yet recognizable.

After establising the baseground for my own work, I started getting my hands dirty: straight into the project’s repo, diving in the code structure and adding my first html and scss snippets. Thanks to the clarity of the project structure and the fact that it was a familiar stack to me (Rails, Angular, Sass and Coffeescript), I was beeing productive in code after a couple of days, even writing my own Angular directives.

### A System, Not Pages

Once my introduction into the project was completed, I focused into creating a design system. Having a styleguide was always a main concern of me on this project, even if sometimes is hard to create patterns in an early startup environment, where things change very quick.

### A Mobile Approach

While most of the pages were responsive, we decided to create a different experience for mobile users, by using a different website for those than comes from cellphones and tablets. While requirements and markup was different, most of the styling was shared by the two sites, through media queries.

### Platform Features

A lot of fifferent features of the platform were created while I was on the project, I worked hand to hand with Product and Engineering teams in order to think, design, code and deliver those to the end users.

### The Experience View

The most important page of the platform, the experience view, was my first task on Worldly. While the first version was usable, we received a decent amount of feedback from our users, so after a couple of months, we felt pretty confident to re-align it. Readibility was the main priority, while usability of the main call to actions was the second most requested issue.

### Static Pages

I was also in charge of leading the redesign of all the static pages of the site, including a new homepage, where the goal was to highlight users already created content.


### Finale

I really enjoyed my time on Worldly, I learnt a lot while working with a very skilled and smart team, which allowed me to think freely and make my own ideas to fly.
