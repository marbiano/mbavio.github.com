The first review of Andy Weir’s The Martian I read was Jez Burrows’ earlier this year. Despite his misgivings concerning the protagonist’s tone, I couldn’t resist the setup and read it the following week. It’s an engrossing, exhaustively researched tale of resourcefulness whose genesis as a self-published serial is well documented. I’m pretty sure you’ve already read it.
