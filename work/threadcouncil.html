          <p>The concept of putting artists in front is one of the key ideas behind Thread Council, so we worked really hard on figuring out how to highlight that feature. In the end, we decided to create a presentation page, that is used each time an artist is added to the brand&#8217;s roster. Inside that page, we introduce the artist with his story, and also run a launch campaign with one of his shirts.</p>

          <p>We knew from the beggining that not everybody were gonna be driven by the desire to support  an artist, there are some people who just hunt for great shirt designs. So we also created an enticing product page in order to properly showcase designs &amp; t-shirt quality.</p>

          <p>In order to show how Thread Council could change the apparel industry, we created high fidelity prototypes of a tentative admin section, where artists could directly connect with their fans, by adding new designs, talking with them and seing stats for their sales. No  hidden info.</p>
